    "content": "# How to Contribute F3D welcomes all contributors, regardless of skill level or experience! ## Contributing as a User Contributing to F3D can be as simple as pointing out a spelling mistake on the website, reporting a bug you encountered, or suggesting a new feature you feel would improve the application. We use [GitHub](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d) to manage the project and you can report new issues or weigh in on existing ones via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues). Also, do not hesitate to join our [Discord](https://discord.f3d.app)! ## How to Get Started With Development To contribute to F3D as a developer, first you may want to try and build F3D for yourself. If you are already familiar with software compilation, you can take a look at our [build guide](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/BUILD.html). If not, you may want to look at our [getting started guide](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/GETTING_STARTED.html), that provide steps to compile F3D. Once you are able to build F3D, you may want to take a look at the open [issues](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues)! If you are a beginner, you may want to look at [\"good first issues\"](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). If you already have some experience with programming and contribution, definitely look at [\"help wanted\"](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) issues. If an issue is interesting to you and is not yet assigned, then you should *comment on the issue* and ask for any help or clarification needed. F3D maintainers will see your comment, assign the issue to you and provide guidance as needed. To get involved more deeply, please take a look at the [roadmaps](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/ROADMAPS_AND_RELEASES.html) for the upcoming releases. It is also recommended to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.f3d.app) to simplify communication, but it is not required. You can then fix the issue or implement the feature on your side and contribute it to the F3D repository by following the workflow described below. Of course, if you are already using F3D and want to improve it for your specific needs, because you want a feature or found a bug, that is definitely possible. Feel free to reach out for guidance by opening an issue or asking on [Discord](https://discord.f3d.app). Another way to get started is to improve the documentation, look for typos, or improve the examples and the gallery. Please share any ideas you may have! ## F3D Development Workflow F3D uses [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/). In a few words, here is how to contribute: - [Fork](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/fork) the F3D repository on GitHub. - Create and push a feature branch on your fork containing new commits. - When it is ready for review or when you want to run the CI, create a pull request against `f3d-app/f3d/master`. - Once the PR is approved and CI comes back clean, a F3D maintainer will merge your pull request in the master branch. - The master now contains your changes and will be present in the next release! ## Continuous Integration F3D has pretty extensive continuous integration trying to cover all usecases for F3D. It means that if the change in your pull request breaks continuous integration, it will not be merged until it passes successfully. It also means that adding a new feature or behavior means adding an associated test. Make sure to check the results for yourself and ask for help if needed. F3D continuous integration will also check the coverage as it is a good way to evaluate if new features are being tested or not. When adding code to F3D, always try to cover it by adding/modifying [tests](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/TESTING.html). F3D continuous integration also checks formatting using clang-format and will inform you if changes needs to be made. Some [formatting rules](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/CODING_STYLE.html) are not enforced by clang-format and will be checked during the review process. When making changes to the `libf3d` public API, continuous integration will warn about making related changes to the bindings. This is required in order to merge the pull request. ## Changelog Whenever you make significant changes, either bugfixes or features, please update the [changelog](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/CHANGELOG.html) \"Ongoing development\" section. There are three subsections. \"For F3D Users\" are changes that impact actual F3D users and are related to F3D behaviors changing. \"For developers\" are changes that impact developers that build F3D. \"For F3D packagers\" are changes that impact anyone packaging F3D, eg: new CMake options. ## F3D Architecture F3D is divided into different components: - The `f3d` executable, in the `application` folder. - The `libf3d` library, in the `library` folder. - The extensions to VTK, in the `vtkext` folder. - The bindings for Python, Java, and WebAssembly, in their respective folders. - The plugins, providing all the different readers in the plugins directory. The extensions to VTK are divided into two modules: - The [private module](vtkext/private) is used exclusively by `libf3d`. - The [public module](vtkext/public) is used by `libf3d` and also by plugins. Additional documentation can be found in [PLUGINS.md](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/libf3d/PLUGINS.html). The `libf3d` library implements the whole logic of instancing and manipulating the different VTK classes, it is fully documented in the [libf3d README](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/libf3d/README_LIBF3D.html). The `f3d` executable itself uses `libf3d` and adds an application layer on top of it, especially the handling of [command line options](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/OPTIONS.html) and a [configuration file](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/CONFIGURATION_FILE.html).

F3D (pronounced `/f…õd/`) is a fast and minimalist 3D viewer desktop application. It supports many file formats, from digital content to scientific datasets (including glTF, USD, STL, STEP, PLY, OBJ, FBX, Alembic), can show animations and support thumbnails and many rendering and texturing options including real time physically based rendering and raytracing. It is fully controllable from the command line and support configuration files. It can provide thumbnails, support interactive hotkeys, drag&drop and integration into file managers. F3D also contains the libf3d, a simple library to render meshes, with a C++17 API, Python Bindings, and experimental Java and Javascript bindings. *A typical render by F3D* *Animation of a glTF file within F3D* *A direct scalars render by F3D* See the [gallery](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/GALLERY.html) for more images, take a look at the [changelog](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/CHANGELOG.html) or go to the [install guide](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/INSTALLATION.html) to download and install F3D! You can even use F3D directly in your [browser](https://f3d.app/web)! If you need any help or want to discuss with other F3D users and developers, head over to our [discord](https://discord.f3d.app). # Quickstart Open a file directly in F3D or from the command line by running: ``` f3d /path/to/file.ext ``` Optionally, append `--output=/path/to/img.png` to save the rendering into an image file. See the [Quickstart Guide](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/QUICKSTART.html) for more information about getting started with F3D. # Documentation - To get started, please take a look at the [user documentation](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/README_USER.html). - If you need any help, are looking for a feature or found a bug, please open an [issue](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/issues). - If you want to use the libf3d, please take a look at its [documentation](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/libf3d/README_LIBF3D.html). - If you want to build F3D, please take a look at the [developer documentation](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/README_DEV.html). # Support F3D needs your help! If you can, please consider sponsoring F3D. Even a small donation would help us offset the recurring maintenance costs. With enough sponsors we would even be able to add support for new devices (as we would need do acquire or rent them first). Read more about it on our [sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/f3d-app). If not, please use F3D, star it on github and share the word about it! # Vision As a minimalist 3D viewer F3D aims to: - Support as many 3D file formats as possible - Support many types of renderings (textures, edges, etc... ) and visualizations (meshes, volumic, point sprites) - Support any and all use-cases dealing with 3D datasets - Let any user easily and quickly view any model with good defaults - Be as configurable as possible - Be fully controllable from the command line and configuration file - Be usable non-interactively - Be as modular as possible to be built with a small number of dependencies but there is no plan to: - Provide a classic mouse-based UI, with menus and buttons - Provide data processing tools - Provide export feature # Contributing F3D as a community-driven, inclusive and beginner-friendly project. We love to see how the project is growing thanks to the contributions from the community. We would love to see your face in the list below! If you want to contribute to F3D, you are very welcome to!

    "content": "# Build guide F3D uses a CMake based build system, so building F3D just requires installing needed dependencies, configuring and building. If you are not used to such processes please take a look at our [getting started guide](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/GETTING_STARTED.html). ## Dependencies * [CMake](https://cmake.org) >= 3.1. * [VTK](https://vtk.org) >= 9.2.6 (9.3.1 recommended). * A C++17 compiler. * A CMake-compatible build system (Visual Studio, XCode, Ninja, Make, etc.). * Optionally (but recommended), [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/) >= 1.91.5. * Optionally, [Assimp](https://www.assimp.org/) >= 5.0. * Optionally, Open CASCADE [OCCT](https://dev.opencascade.org/) >= 7.5.2. * Optionally, [Alembic](http://www.alembic.io/) >= 1.7. * Optionally, [OpenUSD](https://openusd.org/release/index.html) >= 23.05. * Optionally, [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/download/) >= 10.0.0, enable `IOOpenVDB` VTK module. * Optionally, [Draco](https://google.github.io/draco/) >= 1.5. * Optionally, [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.6 and [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) >= 2.2. * Optionally, [Java](https://www.java.com) >= 18. * Optionally, [OpenEXR](https://openexr.com/en/latest/) >= 3.0. ## VTK compatibility As stated in the dependencies, F3D is compatible with VTK >= 9.2.6, however, some features may not be available. We suggest using VTK 9.3.1 with RenderingRayTracing, IOExodus and IOOpenVDB modules enabled in order to get as many features as possible in F3D. ## Configuration and building Configure and generate the project with CMake, then build the software using your build system. Here is some CMake options of interest: * `F3D_BUILD_APPLICATION`: Build the F3D executable. * `BUILD_TESTING`: Enable the [tests](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/TESTING.html). * `F3D_MACOS_BUNDLE`: On macOS, build a `.app` bundle. * `F3D_WINDOWS_GUI`: On Windows, build a Win32 application (without console). * `F3D_WINDOWS_BUILD_SHELL_THUMBNAILS_EXTENSION`: On Windows, build the shell thumbnails extension. * `F3D_PLUGINS_STATIC_BUILD`: Build all plugins as static library (embedded into `libf3d`) and automatically loaded by the application. Incompatible with `F3D_MACOS_BUNDLE`. * `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`: Build the libf3d and all plugins as static library (embedded into `f3d` executable). The `library` and `plugin_sdk` component will not be installed. Some modules, plugins and language bindings depending on external libraries can be optionally enabled with the following CMake variables: * `F3D_MODULE_RAYTRACING`: Support for raytracing rendering. Requires that VTK has been built with `OSPRay` and `VTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_RenderingRayTracing` turned on. Disabled by default. * `F3D_MODULE_EXR`: Support for OpenEXR images. Requires `OpenEXR`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_MODULE_UI`: Support for ImGui widgets. Requires `ImGui`. Enabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_EXODUS`: Support for ExodusII (.ex2) file format. Requires that VTK has been built with `IOExodus` module (and `hdf5`). Enabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_OCCT`: Support for STEP, IGES, BREP, and XBF file formats. Requires `OpenCASCADE`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_ASSIMP`: Support for FBX, DAE, OFF, DXF, X and 3MF file formats. Requires `Assimp`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_ALEMBIC`: Support for ABC file format. Requires `Alembic`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_DRACO`: Support for DRC file format. Requires `Draco`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_USD`: Support for USD file format. Requires `OpenUSD`. Disabled by default. * `F3D_PLUGIN_BUILD_VDB`: Support for VDB file format. Requires that VTK has been built with `IOOpenVDB` module (and `OpenVDB`). Disabled by default. * `F3D_BINDINGS_PYTHON`: Generate python bindings (requires `Python` and `pybind11`). Disabled by default. * `F3D_BINDINGS_JAVA`: Generate java bindings (requires `Java` and `JNI`). Disabled by default. ## VCPKG It's possible to use VCPKG to automatically build dependencies. A manifest file `vcpkg.json` is available at your convenience. Please read [VCPKG documentation](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html). Basically, just install VCPKG, and configure F3D using `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` option. ## Installing Installation can be done through CMake, by running the following command: ``` cmake --install ${your_build_dir} ``` Individual components can also be installed by specifying the component name: ``` cmake --install ${your_build_dir} --component ${component_name} ``` Here is the list of all the components: Name|Installed by default|Operating system|Description ------|------|------|------ `application`|YES|ALL|F3D application. `configuration`|NO|ALL|Default configuration files, `config` and `thumbnail`. `library`|YES|ALL|libf3d library binaries. `plugin`|YES|ALL|libf3d plugins. `dependencies`|NO|ALL|libf3d runtime dependencies.

    "title": "Testing",
    "content": "# Testing F3D has an extensive suite of tests that can be run locally, either to validate your build or because you are contributing to F3D and want to add/modify a test. ## CMake Options There are a few CMake options to configure the F3D testing framework: * `BUILD_TESTING`: Enable the test framework, off by default. Requires [git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) if repository is cloned. * `F3D_TESTING_ENABLE_RENDERING_TESTS`: An option to enable/disable test that require rendering capabilities, on by default. * `F3D_TESTING_ENABLE_LONG_TIMEOUT_TESTS`: Certain tests can take some time to run, off by default, requires rendering tests. * `F3D_TESTING_FORCE_RENDERING_BACKEND`: Configure the rendering backend to use. Can be `auto` (default), `glx`, `wgl`, `egl` or `osmesa`. * `F3D_TESTING_ENABLE_GLX_TESTS`: Enable tests requiring a X11 server running on Linux. * `F3D_TESTING_ENABLE_OSMESA_TESTS`: Enable tests requiring OSMesa dependency. * `F3D_TESTING_ENABLE_EGL_TESTS`: Enable tests requiring EGL dependency. * `F3D_TESTING_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_GLFW`: Enable libf3d tests requiring GLFW dependency. * `F3D_TESTING_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_QT`: Enable libf3d tests requiring QT dependency. ## Running the tests To run all tests, build and then run `ctest` from the build directory: ``` cmake --build . ctest ``` To run a specific test, use the `ctest -R ` option: ``` ctest -R PLY ``` ## Testing architecture There are multiple layers of tests to ensure that testing covers all aspects of the application. The layers of the application are - Application layer - Library layer - Bindings layer - VTK Extension layer When contributing to F3D, it is necessary that new code is covered by a test in at least one layer above. Additional tests can be created in other layers, depending on the change. ### Application layer All application tests are initiated via the `CTest` (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Testing%20With%20CMake%20and%20CTest.html) testing framework. `CTest` runs `f3d` with the `--output` and `--ref` arguments which renders an output image and compares it to a reference image. F3D compares the differences between the 2 images and compute a difference value and compare it to a threshold to check if a test passes or not. All aspects of the application test framework are handled in `application/testing/CMakeLists.txt`. Usually, adding a test is as simple as adding a line like this one: ``` f3d_test(NAME TestName DATA datafile.ext ARGS --args-to-test) ``` where - `NAME` should be the name of the test, which must be unique - `DATA` should be a file in `testing/data` directory, though adding a new file is possible - `ARGS` should be the F3D options to pass to the f3d executable, if any Once the new test has been added, configure and build F3D, then run the test (`-VV` for verbose output): ``` ctest -R TestName -VV ``` The test will run and fail but an image output will be generated in the build directory, namely `Testing/Temporary/TestName.png`. Visually check that the generated file looks as expected, then add it to the F3D sources in `testing/baselines`. Rerun the test, it should now pass. ### Recovering baselines from CI Occasionally you may need to recover a baseline from the CI. If this is required, create a PR and let the test run and fail on CI. Check the actions run summary on Github and download the appropriate `baseline` archive. Extract the archive and navigate to the `build/Testing/Temporary/TestName.png`. Visually check that the generated file looks as expected, then add it to the F3D sources in `testing/baselines`. ### Creating Interaction tests Sometimes you may contribute changes that affect how the end user interacts with F3D, example, toggling orthographic projection on/off or zooming in/out of the rendered image. These human interactions are simulated by interaction tests. F3D has the functionality to record human interactions such as mouse wheel scrolls, mouse movements as well as keypresses to a file. This functionality is enabled by running ``` f3d --interaction-test-record ./TestName.log ``` where - `TestName` should be the name of the test case. While recording the interaction, care should be taken to perform the minimum number of events to simulate the interaction. For example, if you want to simulate the number `5` being pressed, there should be no mouse events or other keypress events during the recording of the interaction. The interaction file is saved when `f3d` is exited. You can verify that your interaction file is correct by playing back the interaction ``` f3d --interaction-test-play ./TestName.log ``` Interactions that are not needed for the test can be removed manually. After verifying that the interaction file works as expected, copy it to `./testing/recordings`. The name of the interaction file should be the same as the test name. The interaction test case can then be created by adding ``` f3d_test(NAME TestName DATA datafile.ext INTERACTION) ``` to `application/testing/CMakeLists.txt` where - `INTERACTION` signifies that this is an interaction test The steps to running the test are the same as above. ### Library layer When for some reason adding a test in the application layer is not possible, it is possible to add a C++ test in the library layer. These tests are simple C++ methods that should return `EXIT_SUCCESS` or `EXIT_FAILURE`. Library test cases are handled in `library/testing`. To add a test, create a new `TestSDKName.cxx` file containing a `int TestSDKName(int argc, char* argv[])` method, then implement your test in C++ using the [libf3d](../libf3d/README.md) API. Then add you new file to `src/library/testing/CMakeLists.txt`. It is supported to read file as input and perform image comparison against baselines as an output, see other tests as examples. ### Bindings layer The libf3d supports multiple bindings, including Python, Java and Javascript. When improving/modifying these bindings, it is necessary to also improve/modify the bindings tests accordingly. Please take a look into `/testing` for examples to follow. ### VTKExtensions layer When for some reason adding a test in the application or library layer is not possible, it is possible to add a C++ test in the VTKExtensions layer. These tests are simple C++ methods that should return `EXIT_SUCESS` or `EXIT_FAILURE`. Everything is handled in `library/VTKExtensions/ModuleName/Testing`. To add a test, first identify which VTKExtensions module you need to add a test into, then create a new `TestName.cxx` file containing a `int TestName(int argc, char* argv[])` method, then implement your test in C++ using VTK and F3D VTKExtensions modules. Then add you new file to `library/VTKExtensions/ModuleName/Testing/CMakeLists.txt`. It is supported to read file as input if needed, see other tests as examples. ",

    "doc": "Classes Introduction",
    "title": "Classes Introduction",
    "content": "# Classes Introduction This is only an introduction to libf3d classes. For the complete documentation, please consult the [libf3d doxygen documentation.](https://f3d.app/doc/libf3d/doxygen/). ## Engine class The engine class is the main class that needs to be instantiated. All other classes instance are provided by the engine using getters, `getScene`, `getWindow`, `getInteractor`, `getOptions`. The engine factory lets you choose between the different types of OpenGL rendering backend. The generic `create()` is recommended in most cases and will use the best context possible available on your system. However, it's possible to force the rendering backend in some specific use cases: * `createGLX()`: force usage of GLX backend, works on Linux only and requires a X11 server to run. * `createWGL()`: force usage of WGL native backend on Windows. * `createEGL()`: force usage of EGL backend, recommended when doing offscreen rendering with a GPU available. Requires EGL library available. No interactor provided. * `createOSMesa()`: force usage of OSMesa backend (software rendering), recommended when doing offscreen rendering without any GPU. Requires OSMesa library available. No interactor provided. * `createNone()`: do not use any rendering. Useful to retrieve metadata only. * `createExternal()`: the user is responsible of the rendering stack. It lets the user integrate libf3d in other frameworks like Qt or GLFW. No interactor provided. See [Context](#context-class) documentation for more info. An additional boolean argument is available to specify if offscreen rendering is requested when relevant on the selected rendering backend. A static function `loadPlugin` can also be called to load reader plugins. It must be called before loading any file. An internal plugin containing VTK native readers can be loaded by calling `f3d::engine::loadPlugin(\"native\");`. Other plugins maintained by F3D team are available if their build is enabled: `alembic`, `assimp`, `draco`, `exodus`, `occt` and `usd`. If CMake option `F3D_PLUGINS_STATIC_BUILD` is enabled, the plugins listed above are also static just like `native` plugin. All static plugins can be loaded using `f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins()`. ## Scene class The scene class is responsible to `add` file from the disk into the scene. It supports reading multiple files at the same time and even mesh from memory. It is possible to `clear` the scene and to check if the scene `supports` a file. ## Context class Convenience class providing generic context API when using a external rendering backend (using `f3d::engine::createExternal()` factory). ## Window class The window class is responsible for rendering the data. Window lets you `render`, `renderToImage` and control other parameters of the window, like icon or windowName. ## Interactor class When provided by the engine, the interactor class lets you choose how to interact with the data. It contains the animation API to start and stop animation. Interactor lets you add, remove and trigger your [commands](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/COMMANDS.html). The commands let you interact with the libf3d in a very flexible manner. Interactor also lets you add and remove bindings in order to modify how the libf3d react to different interactions, eg. when a key is pressed or when a file is dropped. This API also lets you control the content of the cheatsheet. Use `log::setVerboseLevel(log::VerboseLevel::DEBUG)` to print debug information on interaction and command use. Of course, you can use `start` and `stop` to control the interactor behavior. ## Camera class Provided by the window, this class lets you control the camera. You can either specify the camera position, target, and up direction directly, or specify movements relative to the current camera state. ## Image class A generic image class that can either be created from a window, from an image filepath or even from a data buffer. It supports comparison making it very practical in testing context. ## Log class A class to control logging in the libf3d. Simple using the different dedicated methods (`print`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) and `setVerboseLevel`, you can easily control what to display. Please note that, on windows, a dedicated output window may be created. ## Options class This class lets you control the behavior of the libf3d. An option is basically a value that can be a optional or not. There is different API to access it, see the exhaustive [doc](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/libf3d/OPTIONS.html). ## Reader class This class is used internally by the [plugin SDK](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/libf3d/PLUGINS.html) and is not intended to be used directly. ## Plugin class This class is used internally by the [plugin SDK](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/libf3d/PLUGINS.html) and is not intended to be used directly.

    "content": "# Language Bindings ## Python If the python bindings have been generated using the `F3D_BINDINGS_PYTHON` CMake option, the libf3d can be used directly from python. Make sure to set `PYTHONPATH` to path where the python module is built. Here is an example showing how to use libf3d python bindings: ```python import f3d eng = f3d.Engine(f3d.Window.NATIVE) eng.options.update({ \"model.scivis.array-name\": \"Normals\", \"model.scivis.component\": 0, \"ui.bar\": True, \"render.grid.enable\": True, }) eng.scene.add(\"f3d/testing/data/dragon.vtu\") eng.interactor.start() ``` You can see more examples using python bindings in the dedicated example folder [here](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/examples/libf3d/python). ## Java (experimental) If the Java bindings have been generated using the `F3D_BINDINGS_JAVA` CMake option, the libf3d can be used directly from Java. You can import the `f3d.jar` package and use the provided Java classes directly. Make sure to set `java.library.path` to the path where the JNI library is built. Here is an example showing how to use libf3d Java bindings: ```java import app.f3d.F3D.*; public class F3DExample { public static void main(String[] args) { Engine.autoloadPlugins(); // Always use try-with-resources idiom to ensure the native engine is released try (Engine engine = new Engine(Window.Type.NATIVE)) { Scene scene = engine.getScene(); scene.add(\"f3d/testing/data/dragon.vtu\"); engine.getWindow().render(); } } } ``` ## Javascript (experimental) If the Javascript bindings have been generated by building F3D with webassembly and emscriptem, the libf3d can be used directly from a browser. See the dedicated [build](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/BUILD_WASM.html) guide, this [example app](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/blob/master/webassembly/example.html) which you can test live [here](https://f3d.app/web/)!

The documentation about option parsing is upcoming. ```cpp f3d::engine eng = f3d::engine::create(); f3d::options& opt = eng.getOptions(); opt.setAsString(\"render.show_edges\", \"true\"); opt.setAsString(\"render.grid.enable\", \"true\"); opt.setAsString(\"ui.metadata\", \"true\"); opt.setAsString(\"model.material.roughness\", \"0.6\"); ``` When using this API make sure to catch exceptions has needed, eg: ```cpp f3d::engine eng = f3d::engine::create(); f3d::options& opt = eng.getOptions(); try { std::cout << userProvidedName << \": \" << opt.getAsString(userProvidedName) << std::endl; } catch (const f3d::options::inexistent_exception&) { std::cout << userProvidedName << \" does not exist.\" << std::endl; } catch (const f3d::options::no_value_exception&) { std::cout << userProvidedName << \" is not set.\" << std::endl; } ``` ## Variant API An API that is similar to the F3D 2.0 options API thanks to std::variant. ```cpp f3d::engine eng = f3d::engine::create(); f3d::options& opt = eng.getOptions(); opt.set(\"render.show_edges\", true); opt.set(\"render.grid.enable\", true); opt.set(\"ui.metadata\", true); opt.set(\"model.material.roughness\", 0.6); ``` When using this API make sure to catch exception shown above with the string API.

    "content": "# libf3d - A library to render 3D meshes By Michael Migliore and Mathieu Westphal. libf3d is a BSD-licensed C++17 library to open and render 3D meshes. It is of course used by F3D. libf3d API is simple and easy to learn. Python bindings are provided through pybind11. Java bindings are also available. libf3d API is still in alpha version and may change drastically in the future. ## Getting Started Rendering a file and starting the interaction is very easy: ```cpp #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Add a file into a scene eng.getScene().add(\"path/to/file.ext\"); // Start rendering and interacting eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` As well as loading multiple files: ```cpp #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Load multiples geometries eng.getScene().add({\"path/to/file.ext\", \"path/to/file2.ext\"}); // Start rendering and interacting eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` It's also possible to load a geometry from memory buffers: ```cpp #include #include #include // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Create a single triangle f3d::mesh_t mesh = {}; mesh.points = { 0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f, 0.f, 1.f, 0.f, 0.f }; mesh.face_sides = { 3 }; mesh.face_indices = { 0, 1, 2 }; eng.getScene().add(mesh); // Start rendering and interacting eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` Manipulating the window directly can be done this way: ```cpp #include #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine with a offscreen window f3d::engine eng = f3d::engine::create(true); // Load a geometry eng.getScene().add(\"path/to/file.ext\"); // Set the window size and render to an image f3d::image img = eng.getWindow().setSize(300, 300).renderToImage(); // Save the image to a file img.save(\"/path/to/img.png\"); ``` Changing some options can be done this way: ```cpp #include #include #include #include // Load VTK native readers f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins(); // Create a f3d::engine f3d::engine eng(); // Recover the options and set the wanted value options& opt = eng.getOptions(); opt.render.effect.ambient_occlusion = true; opt.render.effect.anti_aliasing = true; // Standard libf3d usage eng.getScene().add(\"path/to/file.ext\"); eng.getInteractor().start(); ``` Most options are dynamic, some are only taken into account when loading a file. See the [options](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/libf3d/OPTIONS.html) documentation. Find more examples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/examples), you can also find other usages in the [testing directory](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/library/testing). For the complete documentation, please consult the [libf3d doxygen documentation.](https://f3d.app/doc/libf3d/doxygen/). ## Building against the libf3d Please follow instructions in the [F3D build guide](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/BUILD.html), make sure to build with `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` and to install the `sdk` component then use CMake to find the libf3d and link against it like this in your CMakeLists.txt: ```cmake find_package(f3d REQUIRED COMPONENTS library) [...] target_link_libraries(target f3d::libf3d) ``` ## find_package COMPONENTS When using `find_package(f3d)` and `sdk` CMake component have been installed, you can require specific components: - `application`: access to f3d::f3d target - `library`: access to f3d::libf3d target and include dir - `plugin_sdk`: access to CMake macros to create plugins, the f3d::vtkext target and include dir see the installed `f3dConfig.cmake` file for more info. ## Extending libf3d with plugins In order to add new supported file format to libf3d, you can create a plugin using CMake macros. Please follow instructions in the [F3D plugin SDK guide](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/libf3d/PLUGINS.html). Also make sure the `plugin_sdk` component have been installed as well as the `sdk` component. ",

You will then be able to call `find_package(f3d REQUIRED COMPONENTS pluginsdk)` in your plugin CMakeLists.txt, a few macros are made available to you to generate a plugin which allow you to extend libf3d to support your own file format. Access to a f3d::vtkext VTK module is also provided if needed. > Please consider [contributing](/pages/wahello/f3d/CONTRIBUTING.html) your plugin in [F3D directly](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/plugins) if you think it can be useful to the community. > You can also consider contributing directly [in VTK](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/blob/master/Documentation/dev/git/develop.md). ## Creating a plugin You can take a look at the example in the [examples/plugin](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/examples/plugins) directory or at the official [plugins](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d/tree/master/plugins). The first thing (and most difficult part) you have to do is creating a VTK reader (or a VTK importer if you want to support a full scene with materials, lights and cameras), and wrap it into a VTK module. You can create several readers in the same VTK module if you need to support several file formats in a single plugin. Then, declare the reader(s) and the plugin using the CMake macros: ```cmake f3d_plugin_init() f3d_plugin_declare_reader( NAME \"ReaderName\" EXTENSIONS \"myext\" # set the extensions the reader can support MIMETYPES \"application/vnd.myext\" # set the mimetypes the reader can support VTK_READER ${vtk_classname} # set the name of the VTK class you have created DESCRIPTION \"Reader description\" # set the description of the reader EXCLUDE_FROM_THUMBNAILER # add this flag if you don't want thumbnail generation for this reader ) # More f3d_plugin_declare_reader calls are possible f3d_plugin_build( NAME \"PluginName\" VERSION 1.0 DESCRIPTION \"Plugin description\" VTK_MODULES CommonCore CommonExecutionModel # Add more VTK modules if necessary ) ``` If the build succeeds, a library called `libf3d-plugin-.so` will be created (`f3d-plugin-.dll` on Windows) A JSON file of the following form will also be generated. It's used by F3D internally to get information about supported file formats. ```json { \"description\" : \"Plugin description\", \"name\" : \"PluginName\", \"readers\" : [ { \"description\" : \"Reader description\", \"extensions\" : [ \"myext\" ], \"mimetypes\" : [ \"application/vnd.myext\" ], \"name\" : \"ReaderName\" } ], \"type\" : \"MODULE\", \"version\" : \"1.0\" } ``` The list of existing mimetypes can be find [here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). If your file format is not listed, the mimetype should be `application/vnd.${extension}` ## Loading your plugin The plugin can be loaded using `f3d::engine::loadPlugin(\"path or name\")` API if you are using libf3d, or `--load-plugins=\"path or name\"` option if you are using F3D application. The option can also be set in a configuration file that you could distribute with your plugin. ## f3d::vtkext F3D provides access to a VTK modules containing utilities that may be useful for plugin developers: - `vtkF3DFaceVaryingPointDispatcher`: A VTK filter that manipulates point data so that F3D can display them as face-varying data (used by `usd` plugin) - `vtkF3DBitonicSort`: A VTK class that perform Bitonic Sort algorithm on the GPU (used by the `splat` point sprites rendering algorithm - `vtkF3DImporter`: An Importer class that abstract away support for different version of VTK after some API changes.

We provide some ready to use color maps files, listed in the table below: Name|Image ------|------ cividis| cubehelix| gist_earth| hot| inferno| magma| plasma| seismic| viridis| It is possible to create a custom color map by creating a simple RGB image in any [supported formats](#supported-formats), and any resolution (if the height is more than 1 row, only the first one is taken into account). The image must be copied in the user config directory: * Linux/macOS: `~/.config/f3d/colormaps` * Windows: `%APPDATA%\\f3d\\colormaps` ### Supported formats Here's the list of all supported image formats that can be used as color maps: - `.png` - `.pnm`, `.pgm`, `.ppm` - `.tif`, `.tiff` - `.bmp` - `.slc` - `.hdr` - `.pic` - `.jpeg`, `.jpg` - `.MR` - `.CT` - `.mhd`, `.mha` - `.tga` - `.exr` (if `F3D_MODULE_EXR` is [enabled](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/dev/BUILD.html)) ## Custom values If no colormap file is specified, it is also possible to set values manually using the `--colormap` option. A list of numbers between 0 and 1 must be specified. The size of the list is a multiple of 4 and each 4-components tuple correspond to the scalar value, followed by the RGB color. For example, the default value corresponds to the `hot` preset which can be defined manually with `--colormap=0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.9,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.9,0.9,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0`.

No argument. `reset_camera`: A specific command to reset the camera to its original location. No argument. `toggle_animation`: A specific command to start/stop the animation. No argument. `add_files [path/to/file1] [path/to/file2]`: A specific command to add files to the scene (overridden by a F3D specific command, see below). Take one or more files as arguments. eg: `add_files /path/to/dragon.vtu`. ## F3D provided specific commands The F3D application provides a few more commands. `load_previous_file_group`: A specific command to load the previous file or file group. No argument. `load_next_file_group`: A specific command to load the next file or file group. No argument. `reload_current_file_group`: A specific command to reload the current file or file group.

Take one or more files as arguments. eg: `add_files_or_set_hdri /path/to/dragon.vtu /path/to/file.hdr`. ## Command syntax Command syntax is similar to bash, as in they will be split by \"token\" to be processed. Tokens are spaces separated, eg: `set scene.up.direction +Z`. Tokens can also be quoted to support spaces inside, eg: `set render.hdri.file \"/path/to/file with spaces.png\"`. Supported quotes are `` `'\" ``, eg: `set render.hdri.file '/path/to/file with spaces.png'`. Quotes inside quotes are supported as well, eg: `set render.hdri.file \"/path/to/file'with'quotes.png\"`. Quotes and spaces can be escaped, eg: `set render.hdri.file /path/to/file\\ with\\ spaces\\ and\\ \\'quotes\\\".png`. Escapes can be escaped too: eg: `set render.hdri.file C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\windows\\\\file.png`. Other escaped character will be processed as if the escape was not present, eg: `set scene.up.direction +\\Z` Unfinished quoted section is invalid, eg: `set scene.up.direction \"+Z` A escape at the end is also invalid, eg: `set scene.up.direction +Z\\` ",

    "content": "# Configuration File Almost all the command-line [options](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/OPTIONS.html) can be controlled using configuration files. Configuration files uses the \"long\" version of the command-line options in a JSON formatted file to provide values for these options. It is also possible to use the [libf3d options](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/libf3d/OPTIONS.html) syntax. These options can be organized by block using a regular expression for each block in order to provide different default values for the different filetypes. Using a command-line option will override similar option set in any config files. Some options are only taken into account on the first load and not on subsequent loads, when switching between files. A typical config file may look like this: ```javascript [ { \"options\": { \"bg-color\": \"0.7,0.7,0.7\", \"color\": \"0.5,0.1,0.1\", \"anti-aliasing\": true, \"timer\": true, \"progress\": true, \"axis\": true, \"bar\": true, \"roughness\": 0.2, \"grid\": true, \"scalar-coloring\": true } }, { \"match\": \".*vt.\", \"options\": { \"edges\": true } }, { \"match\": \".*gl(tf|b)\", \"options\": { \"raytracing\": true, \"denoise\": true, \"samples\": 3 } }, { \"match\": \".*mhd\", \"options\": { \"volume\": true } } ] ``` Here, the first block defines a basic configuration with many desired options for all files. The second block specifies that all files ending with vt., eg: vtk, vtp, vtu, ... will be shown with edges visibility turned on. The third block specifies raytracing usage for .gltf and .glb files. The last block specifies that volume rendering should be used with .mhd files. Single .json file for configuration is supported, as well a config directory containing multiple .json config files. In the case of config directory, .json file are read in alphabetical order and an option in a block can be overridden by the same option being set in another block in another .json file read after. F3D provides a default config directory for generic usage (`config.d`) and a thumbnail specific config directory (`thumbnail.d`). You can edit the file contained in these directory or add your own in specific directories (see below). The following options cannot be set via config file: `help`, `version`, `readers-list`, `config`, `dry-run` and `input`. The following options are only taken on the first load: `no-render`, `output`, and all testing options. Boolean options that have been turned on in the configuration file can be turned off on the command line if needed, eg: `--point-sprites=false`. F3D looks for configuration files in different locations depending on your operating system. Existing configuration files are read in order and combined with later entries, potentially overriding previously read entry with the same names. * Linux: `/etc/f3d/config(.json,.d)`, `/usr/share/f3d/configs/config(.json,.d)`, `[install_dir]/share/f3d/configs/config(.json,.d)`, `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/f3d/config(.json,.d)` * Windows: `[install_dir]\\share\\f3d\\configs\\(config.json,.d)`, `%APPDATA%\\f3d\\(config.json,.d)` * macOS: `/usr/local/etc/f3d/config(.json,.d)`, `f3d.app/Contents/Resources/configs/config(.json,.d)`, `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/f3d/config(.json,.d)` Please note `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` rely on environment variables as specified [here](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html). The binary release will install the default config directory. On Linux, they will be installed in `[install_dir]/share/f3d/configs/`, on Windows, they will be installed in `[install_dir]\\share\\f3d\\configs\\`, on macOS, it will be installed in the bundle. Please note there is a command line option to control the configuration file to read. Using it, one can specify an absolute/relative path for the configuration path, but also only the filename or filestem (`.json` and `.d` will be added) to look for in the locations listed above, , eg: `f3d --config=custom_config` will look for `custom_config.json` and `custom_config.d` in locations listed above. When specifying an absolute/relative path for the configuration file, a single file is read. If not, all files from locations listed above, with the overriding logic specified above. ",

    "title": "Desktop Integration",
    "content": "# Desktop Integration F3D can be integrated in the desktop experience. ## Linux For Linux desktop integration, F3D rely on mime types files as defined by the [XDG standard](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mime-apps-spec/mime-apps-spec-latest.html), .thumbnailer file as specified [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_manager_functionality#Thumbnail_previews) and .desktop file as specified [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_entries). Many file managers use this mechanism, including nautilus, thunar, pcmanfm and caja. The simplest way to obtain desktop integration on Linux is to use a package for your distribution, or the .deb binary release package we provide if compatible with your distribution. In other cases, the binary release archive can be used like this: 0. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is part of your `PATH` 1. Extract F3D binary release archive in `~/.local/` 2. Update your [mime database](https://linux.die.net/man/1/update-mime-database) pointing to `~/.local/share/mime` 3. Update your [desktop database](https://linuxcommandlibrary.com/man/update-desktop-database) pointing to `~/.local/share/application` ```bash export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin tar -xzvf f3d-1.3.0-Linux.tar.gz -C ~/.local/ sudo update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/ sudo update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications ``` F3D supports rendering in environments with limited graphical contexts, including sandboxes or without Xorg running. In most cases, the default behavior will automatically detect which capabilities are available and use the right rendering backend, it is possible to specify it using the `--rendering-backend` CLI option. - If `libEGL.so` is available, you can use: `--rendering-backend=egl`. - If `libOSMesa.so` is available, you can use: `--rendering-backend=osmesa`. - When using `--rendering-backend=auto`, F3D will try to load the following libraries in order and use the first one it was able to load and use: - `libGLX.so` - `libEGL.so` - `libOSMesa.so` You can use that feature for thumbnail generation whenever needed (e.g., Nautilus or other sandboxing file browser), by modifying the [thumbnail config file](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/CONFIGURATION_FILE.html), eg:`~/.config/f3d/thumbnail.json`: ```javascript { \".*\": { \"rendering-backend\": \"egl\" } } ``` If you use the portable archive, make sure to extract it somewhere the sandboxing system has access to, eg: Nautilus uses `bwrap` and gives it access to `/usr` but not to `/opt`. ## Windows For Windows desktop integration, F3D rely on a registered shell extension. Using the F3D NSIS installer (.exe) is the simplest way to enable thumbnails and integrate F3D on windows. It is also possible to do it manually when using the zipped binary release archive, on installation, just run: ``` cd C:\\path\\to\\f3d\\bin\\ regsvr32 F3DShellExtension.dll ``` To remove the shell extension, run: ``` cd C:\\path\\to\\f3d\\bin\\ regsvr32 /u F3DShellExtension.dll ``` ## MacOS There is no support for thumbnails on MacOS, the .dmg binary release provides automatic file openings. ## Limitations - TIFF files are excluded from the thumbnailer to avoid conflicts with other better 2D thumbnailers.

    "content": "# Final shaders It is possible to specify a final full screen shader with the option `--final-shader`. It is executed as the last shader in the rendering pipeline. The shader code can be passed directly as a single code line. It's possible to pass the content of a shader file using the following command: ```sh f3d model.obj --final-shader \"$(cat final.glsl)\" ``` Note that the command above works on Linux and bash, and should be adapted depending on the operating system and the shell/terminal used. ## Requirements It is required to implement the function `vec4 pixel(vec2 uv)`. The value `uv` is ranging from 0 to 1 in both directions. `(0,0)` is the bottom left corner, and `(1,1)` is the upper right corner. The first component is the horizontal direction. ## Uniforms It is possible to access these uniforms: - `source` (type: `sampler2d`): texture of the image generated by rendering pipeline. - `resolution` (type: `ivec2`): resolution of the texture `source`. ## Examples Here are three shader examples to illustrate how an implementation looks like. ### Negative ```glsl vec4 pixel(vec2 uv) { vec3 value = texture(source, uv).rgb; return vec4(vec3(1.0) - value, 1.0); } ``` ### Vignette ```glsl vec4 pixel(vec2 uv) { float l = clamp(1.0 - 2.0 * length(uv - 0.5), 0.0, 1.0); return vec4(l*texture(source, uv).rgb, 1.0); } ``` ### Box blur ```glsl vec4 pixel(vec2 uv) { const float radius = 0.03; const int samples = 20; const float step = radius / float(samples); vec3 sum = vec3(0); for (int i = -samples; i <= samples; i++) { for (int j = -samples; j <= samples; j++) { sum += texture(source, uv + vec2(i, j) * step).rgb; } } float d = 1.0 + 2.0 * float(samples); sum /= d * d; return vec4(sum, 1.0); } ``` ",

    "content": "# Interactions ## 3D Mouse Interactions Simple interaction with the displayed data is possible directly within the window. It is as follows: * *Click and drag* with the *left* mouse button to rotate around the focal point of the camera. * Hold Shift then *Click and drag* horizontally with the *right* mouse button to rotate the HDRI. * *Click and drag* vertically with the *right* mouse button to zoom in/out. * *Move the mouse wheel* to zoom in/out. * Hold Ctrl, then *Click and drag* vertically with the *right* mouse button to zoom in/out to mouse position. * Hold Ctrl, then *Move the mouse wheel* to zoom in/out to mouse position. * *Click and drag* with the *middle* mouse button to translate the camera. * *Click* with the *middle* mouse button to center the camera on the point under the cursor (hold Shift to allow forward or backward movement). > Note: When playing an animation with a scene camera, camera interactions are locked. ## Bindings The coloring can be controlled directly by pressing the following hotkeys: * C: cycle between coloring with array from point data and from cell data. * S: cycle the array to color with. * Y: cycle the component of the array to color with. See the [coloring cycle](#cycling-coloring) section for more info. Other options can be toggled directly by pressing the following hotkeys: * W: cycle animations. * B: display of the scalar bar, only when coloring and not using direct scalars. * V: volume rendering, forces coloring. * I: opacity function inversion during volume rendering. * O: point sprites rendering. * P: translucency support. * Q: ambient occlusion. * A: anti-aliasing. * T: tone mapping. * E: the display of cell edges. * X: the trihedral axes display. * G: the horizontal grid display. * N: the display of the file name. * M: the display of the metadata if exists. * Z: the display of the FPS counter. * R: raytracing. * D: the denoiser when raytracing. * U: background blur, useful with an HDRI skybox. * K: trackball interaction mode. * F: HDRI ambient lighting. * J: the display of the HDRI skybox. * L: increase lights intensity. * Shift+L: decrease lights intensity. Note that the raytracing hotkeys are only available if F3D is build with raytracing enabled. Camera Hotkeys: * 1: front view camera. * 3: right view camera. * 4: roll the camera left by 90 degrees. * 5: toggle orthographic projection. * 6: roll the camera right by 90 degrees. * 7: top view camera. * 9: isometric view camera. * Enter: reset the camera to its initial parameters. Other hotkeys and interactions are available: * H: key to toggle the display of a cheat sheet showing all these hotkeys and their statuses. * ?: key to print scene description to the terminal. * Esc: close the window and quit F3D. * Space: play the animation if any. * &larr;: load the previous file if any and reset the camera. * &rarr;: load the next file if any and reset the camera. * &uarr;: reload the currently loaded files. * &darr;: add all current files parent directories to the list of files, reload the currently loaded files and reset the camera. * F12: take a screenshot, ie. render the current view to an image file. * F11: take a \"minimal\" screenshot, ie. render the current view with no grid and no overlays to an image file with a transparent background. * *Drop* a file, directory or HDRI into the F3D window to load it. F3D relies on the extension (`.hdr` or `.exr`) to detect if the dropped file is an HDRI. * Ctrl + *Drop* a file, directory and load it. * Shift + *Drop* a HDRI and use it, no extensions checks performed. When loading another file or reloading, options that have been changed interactively are kept as is. ## Cycling Coloring The following hotkeys let you cycle the coloring of the data: * C: cycle between point data and cell data - field data is not supported. * S: cycle the array available on the currently selected data in alphabetical order, skipping array not containing numeric data. It will loop back to not coloring unless using volume rendering. * Y: cycle the component available on the currently selected array, looping to -2 for direct scalars rendering. When changing the array, the component in use will be kept if valid with the new array, if not it will be cycled until a valid component is found. When changing the type of data to color with, the index of the array within the data will be kept if valid with the new data. If not, it will cycle until a valid array is found. After that, the component will be checked as specified above. ## Taking Screenshots The destination filename used to save the screenshots (created by pressing F12 or F11) is configurable (using the `screenshot-filename` option) and can use template variables as described [on the options page](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/OPTIONS.html#filename-templating). Unless the configured filename template is an absolute path, images will be saved into the user's home directory (using the following environment variables, if defined and pointing to an existing directory, in that order: `XDG_PICTURES_DIR`, `HOME`, or `USERPROFILE`).

It comes with some known limitations: - PBR materials are not supported for FBX file format. - Complex animations are not working very well with Assimp 5.1, it's recommended to use Assimp 5.0 for this use case. - Only one animation can be shown at a time, showing all animations is not supported yet. - Some files can be empty, crash, or show artifacts. - DXF support is very limited: only files with polylines and 3D faces are displayed. - 3MF files may crash at exit (issue in Assimp: https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/5328) - Only support RBGA 8-bits embedded textures ## Alembic ABC file formats rely on [Alembic](https://github.com/alembic/alembic) library. It comes with some known limitations: - Supports only simple polygonal geometry. - Does not support ArbGeomParam feature in Alembic. - Does not support Subdivision Meshes. - Does not support Materials. - Does not support Animations. ## USD USD file formats rely on [OpenUSD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD) library. It comes with some known limitations: - Skinning is slow and baked on the CPU. - Does not support Face-varying attributes. - The `usd` plugin is not shipped in the python wheels yet. ## VDB VDB file formats rely on [OpenVDB](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb) and VTK libraries. It currently comes with some known limitations: - VDB Grid files are opened with a hard-coded 0.1 sampling rate. - The `vdb` plugin is not shipped in the python wheels yet. ## Gaussian splatting Gaussian splatting (option `--point-sprites-type=gaussian`) needs depth sorting which is done internally using a compute shader. This requires support for OpenGL 4.3 which is not supported by macOS and old GPUs/drivers. # Troubleshooting ## General > I have built F3D with raytracing support but the denoiser is not working. Make sure that VTK has been built with *OpenImageDenoise* support (`VTKOSPRAY_ENABLE_DENOISER` option). > My model shows up all wrong, with inverted surfaces everywhere. Your data probably contains some translucent data for some reason, turn on translucency support by pressing `P` or using the `-p` command line option. ## Linux > I have a link error related to `stdc++fs` not found. With some C++ STD library version, explicit linking to `stdc++fs` is not supported. We provide a CMake option `F3D_LINUX_APPLICATION_LINK_FILESYSTEM` that you can set to `OFF` to workaround this issue. > I have a link error related to undefined reference to symbol of `libatomic`. The GCC flag `-latomic` is not being added automatically with specific architectures, like `armel` and `RISCV64`. We provide a CMake option `F3D_LINUX_LIBRARY_LINK_ATOMIC` that you can set to `ON` to workaround this issue. > Thumbnails are not working in my file manager. * Check that your file manager supports the thumbnailer mechanism. * Check that you have updated your mime type database. * If all fails, remove your `.cache` user dir and check that `pcmanfm` thumbnails are working. * If they are working, then it is an issue specific to your file manager (see below for a potential work around). * If only a few format have working thumbnails, then it is an issue with the mime types database. * If no formats have working thumbnails, then it is can be an issue with sandboxing or with the `f3d-plugin-xxx.thumbnailer` files. * If only big file do not have thumbnails, this is intended, you can modify this behavior in the `thumbnail.d/10_global.json` configuration folder using the `max-size` option. > `--rendering-backend` CLI option is not working as expected Dynamically switching rendering backend require VTK 9.4.0, you may need to update VTK or to use our [binary release](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/INSTALLATION.html). ## Windows > Using the portable binary release, I'm unable to run F3D because Windows warns about a security risk F3D is not signed by Microsoft yet so Windows shows this warning. Just click on the \"more\" button to be able to run F3D. > After installing F3D or registering the shell extension, my explorer is broken. Unregister the shell extension by running: ``` cd C:\\path\\to\\f3d\\bin\\ regsvr32 /u F3DShellExtension.dll ``` > I use F3D in a VM, the application fails to launch. OpenGL applications like F3D can have issues when launched from Windows Server or from a guest Windows because the access to the GPU is restricted. You can try to use a software implementation of OpenGL, called [Mesa](https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases). * Download the latest `release-msvc`. * copy `x64/opengl32.dll`, `libgallium_wgl.dll` and `x64/libglapi.dll` in the same folder as `f3d.exe`. * set the environment variable `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE` to 4.5. * run `f3d.exe`. > I run f3d from the command prompt and my Unicode characters are not displayed properly. Set the codepage to UTF-8, run `chcp 65001`. > When I install F3D, I can't add F3D to the path and the installer complains that: `PATH too long installer unable to modify PATH!`. There are too many entry in your PATH environment variable, remove the ones you do not use. > When I try to update F3D, the installer fails with: `Error opening file for writing: F3DShellExtension.dll` Your previous F3D installation is current being used to generate thumbnails, wait for a bit or reboot your computer before updating again. ## macOS > I'm unable to use the binary release, macOS complains the file is invalid or corrupted Our macOS binary package are not signed, to work around this, you can simply run the following command: ``` xattr -cr /Applications/F3D.app ``` Then F3D should work as expected. ## Python > I can't find `usd` and `vdb` plugins after installing f3d with pip The `usd` and `vdb` plugins are not shipped in the python wheels for now, you can compile F3D yourself with them though. > Raytracing does not work after installing f3d with pip F3D raytracing feature is not shipped in the python wheels for now, you can compile F3D yourself with it though.

    "content": "## Plugins F3D officially supports plugins for certain file formats. If you installed F3D using the binary release, there's no need to manually load these plugins when opening your file. F3D will load them automatically. However, if you installed F3D using a package manager, it's possible that the packager chose to bundle the plugins into different packages or to list plugin dependencies as optional in order to reduce the number of dependencies of the main package. In order to open a file that requires a plugin, make sure you've installed all necessary dependencies. You can then specify the `--load-plugins=` [option](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/OPTIONS.html) in the command line to load your plugin. Alternatively, you can add your plugin directly in the [configuration file](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/CONFIGURATION_FILE.html) if it isn't there already. You can specify one or multiple plugins in a single comma-separated list, like in the example below: ``` [ { \"match\": \".*(file_extension)\", \"options\": { \"load-plugins\": \"plugin1\", \"plugin2\" } } ] ``` ### Supported plugins F3D supports the following plugins and their file formats: - **alembic**: `.abc` - **assimp**: `.fbx`, `.dae`, `.off`, `.dxf`, `.x`, `.3mf` - **draco**: `.drc` - **exodus**: `.ex2` - **occt**: `.step/.stp`, `.iges/.igs` - **usd**: `.usd`, `.usda`, `.usdc`, `.usdz` - **vdb**: `.vdb` (experimental) > Note: If you downloaded the binaries from the release page, it's not necessary to specify manually the plugins above. F3D loads them automatically. Here is how the plugins are searched (in preceding order): 1. Search the static plugins. 2. Consider the `load-plugins` option given it is a full path. 3. Search in the paths specified in `F3D_PLUGINS_PATH` environment variable. 4. Search in a directory relative to the F3D application: `../lib`. 5. Rely on OS specific paths (e.g. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS). You can also try plugins maintained by the community. If you have created a plugin and would like it to be listed here, please submit a pull request. - **Abaqus**: ODB support by @YangShen398 ([repository](https://github.com/YangShen398/F3D-ODB-Reader-Plugin)) ",

    "content": "# Quickstart Guide This guide will help you get started using F3D. As an overview, you'll learn how to run F3D and open files, configure basic scene constructions, interact with them, and play animations. ## Prerequisites To use F3D, you'll need to install F3D. See the [Installation](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/INSTALLATION.html) page for the latest release package supported by your system. ## Running F3D Once F3D has been installed, you should be able to open a file in any of the following ways: * Open a file directly from your file manager. * Open the F3D application directly, then drag and drop a file into the application window. * Run F3D from the terminal with a set of command-line [options](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/OPTIONS.html). * Configure F3D as a [thumbnailer](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/DESKTOP_INTEGRATION.html) for supported file formats with certain file managers. If you choose to run F3D from the terminal, you can open your file by running the following: ``` f3d /path/to/file.ext ``` Optionally, you can also save the rendering into an image file: ``` f3d /path/to/file.ext --output=/path/to/img.png ``` If you need help, specify the `--help` [option](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/OPTIONS.html): ``` f3d --help man f3d # Linux only ``` Once you've opened your file in F3D, you're all set to start visualizing! Press H to open a list of shortcuts to help you interact with your scene. See the [supported file formats](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/SUPPORTED_FORMATS.html) page for the full list of file types that F3D can open. ## Constructing scenes Certain [formats](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/SUPPORTED_FORMATS.html) are listed as **full scene** formats (.gltf/.glb, .3ds, .wrl, .obj, .fbx, .dae, .off, .x, .3mf, .usd) which means these files contain not only *geometry* but also some scene information like *lights*, *cameras*, *actors* in the scene, as well as *texture* properties. By default, all this information will be loaded from the file and displayed. For file formats that are not **full scene**, **a default scene** is created. For **default scene** formats, certain default values are set automatically: - texture-*: \"\" - line-width: 1.0 - point-size: 10.0 - opacity: 1.0 - color: 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 - emissive-factor: 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 - normal-scale: 1.0 - metallic: 0.0 - roughness: 0.3 They will be overridden when using corresponding [options](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/OPTIONS.html). ## Interacting with your scene Once you've loaded your scene in F3D, you can interact with it by using your mouse and certain hotkeys. ### Moving the camera * *Click and drag* with the *left* mouse button to **rotate** around the focal point of the camera. * *Click and drag* vertically with the *right* mouse button OR *move the mouse wheel* to **zoom in/out**. * *Click and drag* with the *middle* mouse button to **translate** the camera. ### Other shortcuts * Press Enter to reset the camera. * Press Space to play animation, if any. * Press G to toggle the horizontal grid. * Press H to display a cheatsheet of hotkey interactions. For more information, see the [Interactions](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/INTERACTIONS.html) page. ## Playing animations F3D can play [animations](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/ANIMATIONS.html) for any [supported files](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/SUPPORTED_FORMATS.html) that contain them. With your file loaded into F3D, press the W hotkey to cycle through available animations. Then, press Space to play your selected animation. Alternatively, you can use the command line to play animations. Use the `--animation-index` [option](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/OPTIONS.html) to specify which animation you want to play. To play all animations at once, use `--animation-index=-1` (`.gltf`/`.glb` only). For more information, see the [Animations](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/ANIMATIONS.html) page. ## Further Reading * [A list of all F3D command-line options.](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/OPTIONS.html) * [How to interact with scenes in F3D.](INTERACTIONS.MD) * [How to play animations in F3D.](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/ANIMATIONS.html) * [How to specify colormaps in F3D.](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/COLOR_MAPS.html) * [How to configure plugins in F3D.](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/PLUGINS.html) * [Limitations and how to troubleshoot F3D.](/pages/wahello/f3d/doc/user/LIMITATIONS_AND_TROUBLESHOOTING.html) ",
